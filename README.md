# 2067-Z8S180
Z8S180 Breakout Board

# WARNING

Some have reported issues with footprints and the M1 signal being routed in a potentially problemic manner.  

Unless you want to help debug and design the second revision of this board, I *strongly* recommend waiting on building this project until a such future revision has been verified as operational!
