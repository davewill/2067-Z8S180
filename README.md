# 2067-Z8S180
Z8S180 Breakout Board

There is a YouTube playlist for the [Z80-Nouveau](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3by7evD3F52rUbThUNDYGxNpKFF1HCNT) project for which this board is an early prototype.

Note that this board plugs into an FPGA board.  See: [2057-ICE40HX4K-TQ144-breakout](https://github.com/johnwinans/2057-ICE40HX4K-TQ144-breakout).

# WARNING

Some have reported issues with footprints and the M1 signal on Rev 1.0.

An attempt has been made to address these issues in Rev 1.1.  But Rev 1.1 has not yet been tested.

Unless you want to help debug and design the second revision of this board, I *strongly* recommend waiting on building this project until a such future revision has been verified as operational!
